# OCR

This is an 'in-browser' OCR tool for handwritten text.
It is based on Microsoft TrOCR, using the 'small-handwritten' version.

Needed improvements:

- Currently not very useful because this model is "single line" only. I'm waiting for Transformers.js v3 to be released in order to try nanoLLaVA, which should be much more robust.
